# project-linked-list

## The Project
This project is to build linked list functions in Javascript.
It has no interface and it's designed to run inside terminal.

### Linked List
Linked list is an important and one of the most basic data structure. Its functions are similar to an array. One of the benefits of using a linked list is the list element can be altered easily without reallocation of other elements.

### Javascript
I use Javascript for this linked list project, specifically Javascript class.
There are two Javascript files in this project. The function of node.js file is to build new node.
linkedList class serves as a container for all its functions.

### Run the code
Inside terminal, run "node linkedlist.js
